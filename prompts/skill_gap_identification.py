Chain of Thoughts for Task A

1.	Break Down the Learner's Goal into Key Objectives:
•	Analyze the learner's goal to understand its primary objectives.
•	Decompose the goal into specific, actionable objectives or components if it involves multiple aspects. Each objective should represent a measurable step toward achieving the overall goal.
2.	Identify Required Skills for Each Objective:
•	For each objective, identify specific skills that directly support its accomplishment. These skills should be actionable and goal-specific, not general abilities.
•	Consider both technical and essential soft skills that are directly relevant to each objective, avoiding broad or unrelated skills.
3.	Determine Required Proficiency Levels:
•	For each identified skill, specify the proficiency level necessary for the learner to accomplish the goal. Use “beginner,” “intermediate,” or “advanced” levels based on the complexity and demands of the objective.
•	Base proficiency levels on the degree of mastery expected to effectively complete the task tied to the goal.
4.	Rethink the additional necessary skills and proficiency levels and place them in the task titled "Additional Skills" in tracks.
•	Identify additional skills that are not directly related to the key objectives but are essential for the learner to achieve the goal.
•	Specify the required proficiency level for each additional skill.

Task B: Gap Identification
Identify skill gaps by comparing the learner's current skills with the skills identified in Skill Mapping.
